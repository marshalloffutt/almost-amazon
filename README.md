# Almost Amazon

## Description
This app is a faux-bookstore that sells only one book, which just happens to be the singular greatest book ever written. The app makes use of event listeners as well as ES6 modules, vanilla JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The purpose of this exercise was to show how an actual e-seller can avoid nefarious users from tampering with costs of items.
